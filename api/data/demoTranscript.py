    {'h2FDq3agImI': "so you want to learn artificial intelligence then this video is for you I'm going to provide you with a complete roadmap that I would follow if I had to start over today on my artificial intelligence journey and now for context I started studying artificial intelligence back in 2013 10 years ago and over the past years I've been working as a freelance data scientist helping my clients with various end-to-end data science and artificial intelligence Solutions and applications I also share all of this knowledge and my journey on this YouTube channel which as of today has over 25 000 subscribers and at the end of this video I will also provide you with a resource completely for free where you can follow all of these steps to complete roadmap even with training videos and instructions so make sure to stick around for that and now before we dive into the seven steps that I would take today to go from beginner all the way to monetizing my data and AI skills it's important to provide some context on what is currently going on with the AI hype because I see a lot of new people entering the field and for a good reason because the AI Market size is expected to grow up to 20 volt by the year 2030 bringing it all the way to nearly 2 trillion US dollars so it's really one of the best opportunities I would say right now to get into because we're still early we're still at the beginning of this AI Revolution and also with the release of these pre-trained models from open AI it's now also easier than ever to enter the field but that said that is also where a lot of the misunderstanding and just wrong expectations arise from because I see a lot of people online as well as on YouTube explaining like how you can quickly start for example your own AI automation agency and while there are great tools already online out there like both press and stack Ai and flowwise which I also made a video on where you can quickly spin up prototypes and and simple Bots and even can get a little bit more advanced don't get me wrong you can definitely build some great Solutions with that but if you really want to learn artificial intelligence and build applications that companies can count on and build upon then you really have to understand the coding part the technical part really of it so that's really where our starting point should be for you and for your learning path figuring out hey do I want to just learn how to use these no code Loco tools already available or do I really want to learn artificial intelligence and with that said there is also just a general misunderstanding I believe of what really AI is because AIS is such a large umbrella term and it's also nothing new it's been around since the 1950s but right now with the chat GPT hype and the open AI models people think AI is that really if we look at what artificial intelligence really is it's like I've said a real big umbrella term with various subfields so for example within artificial intelligence which is here explained as programs with the ability to learn and reason like humans machine learning then we have deep learning which is another subset focusing on neural networks and then we have the field of data science but in my work as a data scientist I use artificial intelligence I use machine learning and I also use deep learning it's a lot more than what people think the first real question that you gotta ask yourself is do you want to be a coder and now there's no right or wrong answer here there are plenty of opportunities right now and also in the future for both Pathways for both local NOCO tools and building custom applications but you just gotta be aware of the pros and cons to both of the sides and not to be totally clear this roadmap is for people that really want to learn AI with the depth of understanding really learn the technical side of things and now if you've decided that that is not for you that's of course totally fine like I said there's no right or wrong but then if you want to still want to do things with AI then I recommend starting out by checking out both press like I've set or stack AI which are excellent resources or you could check out my video on flowwise here on YouTube where I show you how you can get started with a local NOCO 2 as well completely for free but if you do decide that you want to join the Dark Side and become a coder then let's proceed with the next steps my Approach is quite different from anything else you will find online and now why is that and what I typically see online is you have two ends of the the Spectrum basically where on the one hand you have the people talking about these low code and no code tools not really getting into the specific the theoretical part and then on the other hand you have the more classical approaches towards artificial intelligence and machine learning where people really get into the mathematics and the statistics giving you road maps where you really have to get theoretical first I'm a firm believer of learning by doing reverse engineering things that people have already done putting in practice and then trying to fill in the gaps now the technical roadmap that I'm going to provide to you will really focus on the fundamentals that you need in order to get started in either artificial intelligence data science or anything in between like I've said I've worked in all of these fields over the past 10 years and I've really identified the core techniques workflows and tools that you need in order to get started regardless of what you want to do so this will work for you if you just want to build applications with large language models and Lang chain for example but it will also work if you aspire to become a data scientist or a machine learning engineer now the actual first step that I would focus on on my AI Journey would be to set up my work environment now what does this mean so python is the go-to language that we have to learn if you want to get started in AI or in data science but the thing is Titan if you start to follow these tutorials online videos training videos courses even you can quite quickly understand Python and how it works because it's one of the easiest languages to get started with but I found in my personal Journey that there's this initial bump where you see things online and you see people run some code but then you are missing some information on okay but how do I now actually do this on my laptop on my computer and I would really focus on this first setting up an environment on your laptop on your computer where you have an application a program and a python installation that you are confident with and now I have a specific approach that I take over here within fias code and a lot of people seem to like that so make sure to check that out in the resources but this really is step one they're getting accustomed with that and that brings us then to step two which is actually getting started with python it's like I said the most important language this is going to be your tool that you're going to build these applications in now if you're new to programming at all I would first focus on the fundamentals of programming which I will have resources to but then quickly transition into learning the basics of python and then specifically some libraries that are very useful for AI and data science in particular so these would be for example the numpy AI Library the pandas library and the matte plus lib library now these are all libraries that you can use to do data manipulation data cleaning creating visualizations this is really your starting point for starting to work with data because in the end all AI applications all AI tools are created from data with data so being able to work with data and turn raw and unstructured data into information into valuable insights that you can actually do something with is is really at the core of of artificial intelligence and now step three would be to learn the very basics of git and GitHub now why is that some would argue that that would be a little bit more advanced and it's not required in the beginning but what I've found especially with artificial intelligence and also the video tutorials that I make is that a lot of examples online people will make that code available via GitHub but you have to understand kind of at the very base sick how these tools work because that allows you to easily copy and clone is what they call it tutorials that brings us to step 4 which is working on projects and building a portfolio and for this it's convenient if you already know how to use git so you can download some projects download some code from from other people and then try to reverse engineer it to me that really is the best way to to Learn Python to get good to actually understand holistically what a project looks like how people are structuring their code and trying to run it and then you don't understand what's going on but then trying to reverse engineer so it's really like beginning with the end in mind and then trying to change things and see how that affects the different outcomes and this also provides you with an opportunity to explore what it is specifically that you like about artificial intelligence all the areas we've discussed computer vision natural language processing machine learning he here you really find out okay these are all the kinds of things that I can do and this is really what I like to do and then as you're working on these projects selecting them picking them you there will be a lot of gaps and and things you don't understand and that would be a good point if you're interested in that to find specific pieces of information or courses to help you with just that and now when it comes to projects probably the best place to start if you want to learn more about data science and machine learning is kaggle so kaggle is an excellent resource that you can go through and they host machine learning competitions here so you can see all kinds of requests and you can even win prizes so this is one from Google and the cool thing here is if you click on the actual competition you can also actually have a look at submissions that people have made so here you can see an entire notebook from someone that is trying to solve this problem for Google all with documentation and and even the code so this is such an excellent learning resources source that you can go through like I said there are plenty plenty of resources available on here but if that's not for you machine learning data science if you want to just explore large language models in open AI for example right now then I recommend to check out my GitHub repository on Lang chain experiments so I also have videos on my YouTube channel for that but here on the repository that's why it's good that you at least understand the basics of git and GitHub so you can take this code know how to work with it so here are some cool examples of how you connect can create a YouTube bot that can summarize a video or even a slack bolt or a Ponders agent that can ask questions and answer questions about large data tables and now if you're really serious about learning artificial intelligence and data science and another great resource that you can check out is Project Pro which I've recently discovered so project Pro is a curated library of verified and solved end-to-end project Solutions in data science machine learning and big data so overall this is just an excellent resource with with so much information and all the projects on here that you can pick from all from the various fields are all created by top industry experts from leading tech companies so what I really like about this is first of all you have about 3 000 free recipes that like anyone can check out but if you get to the subscription and that is why it really gets interesting you have access to 250 plus end-to-end projects so you can really like go in here and see okay what is it that you're working on so maybe it's data science and you want to specialize in machine learning and you go in here you literally have all kinds of projects and this is not only a great resource for you to learn from because you will have complete video walkthroughs 24 7 support and you can ask questions and and you can even download all of the code so literally the entire project will be made available to you so it's a excellent Learning Resource but also for me personally working as a freelance data scientist this can also like really help me in my professional work that the projects that I take on so for you that could either be in your job or in future jobs freelancing whatever you really have a library that you can pick from that can really give you that extra kind of confidence you need for example to take on a project now like I've said really you see video instructions you can go through everything and then also download the code so this really is a great resource that you can check out and if you want to learn more about this I will leave a link down in the description and project Pro also has a YouTube channel which you can subscribe to if you want to stay in the loop learn more on that and that brings us to step five which is picking your specialization and sharing your knowledge so right now you understand the fundamentals of python you have a work environment and some some efficient workflows that you can follow you also have some project experience so now you get a little bit more clarity of what it is that you want to do within the world of AI or data science or machine learning so this would be the point where you pick a focus area you specialize you try to learn more and also what I really would recommend and what I would do is to start sharing your knowledge so you could do this through a personal blog you could do this through writing articles on medium or towards data science or you could even potentially like I'm doing share your your knowledge on YouTube and by doing so you're not only contributing to the collective knowledge on AI and data science but it's also an essential method for you to strengthen your own learning because in doing so in explaining Concepts that you're working on that you're learning to to someone else you really start to identify the gaps within your understanding and this again allows you to fill in those gaps accordingly and really focus on some specialized learning versus just going through course after course after course and then step six would be continue to learn and upskill because now that you have Clarity on your specialization and kind of the direction that you want to go and you also start to identify these gaps within your own understanding it might be time for you to for example focus on math focus on statistics if you want to become a better machine learning engineer or a data scientist but if you've decided to go with the large language model and generative AI route you might identify that you need some software engineering skills actually really start to understand how you can work with with apis and create applications and that's like I think the main main message that I wanna want to provide you with with regards to this roadmap and and my Approach is that it's everyone's journey is is unique and depending on what you want to do with AI there's a specialized learning path for you specifically so my goal is to really provide you with the tools and techniques to quickly get going get your hands dirty identify problems work on projects and then fill in those gaps and then finally step 7 would be to monetize your skills now this could either be through a job this could be through freelancing or this could be through building a product but where the real Learning Happens is is when there really is some pressure onto it so it's all fun and games when you're trying to explore this within your free time following some courses following some tutorials but when it's your boss or when it's a client that's that's breathing down your neck for the deadline that is where you really push yourself that is where you really get creative get resourceful and try to absorb and learn as much information as possible to just get the job done and that's it those are the seven steps that I would take today if I had to start over completely from scratch on my AI Journey and now another bonus tip that I can provide you which will make a great difference is surround yourself with like-minded individuals who are on the same track the same path as you who share the same interest where you can bounce ideas off where you can share the latest news and tips with and in order to facilitate that for you as well I have an exciting announcement because today I will officially be releasing my free group called Data alchemy that I would like you all to invite you this will be a group where I not only share the complete and entire roadmap that I just shared with you with all the links resources tools it will also be a hub your go-to place to navigate the world of data science and artificial intelligence and everything that's going on and happening right now within this rapidly changing field so if you're serious about learning artificial intelligence and data science and you also also want access to not only this entire roadmap but additional courses and resources then make sure to check out the first link in the pinned comment below this video and then I look forward to seeing you in the group foreign"},
    {'SRZ48WTHohw': "all right today we G to talk about what is the stock market and how does it work now this is truly truly important so we G to navigate through this space like only trap and dude right and I know a lot of people really want to get into the market you really ready to start get investing but I'm going to be honest with you I can't even let you get in the market if you don't really know what it is of course you have an idea but you don't really know how it works so it's my goal my job to help you understand how this thing truly works and just like that the stock market was going off on my I phone and we not going to edit that so I got to get into first right so the stock market is a place where buyers and sellers come together to find a price agreement on a stock now we already talked about what stocks were right it's a portion of a company that you get to buy and take full ownership of now the stock market does have three indices right so you have the S&P 500 which is your 500 biggest stocks and then you have the NASDAQ which is 100 of the more Innovative stocks and then you have the Dow Jones Industrial Average so the Dow Jones Industrial Average um consist of companies like your caterpillar your uh John Deere uh the the industrial companies that that make up the fabric of America but we going to dig a Little Deeper we're going to dig a little deeper into this so um the NASDAQ has about a $23 trillion market cap right remember this your high flying tech stocks right um and then your Dow Jones has about A40 billion uh market cap now the dope part about this is the stock market does have rules right and those rules allow it to be governed by uh uh entity called the SEC right the security Exchange Commission Now their goal is to make sure that everybody playing on the same on the same playing field right because without rules you know people going to do whatever they won't do people going rogue it's definitely going to be a crazy thing going on right here right now the first exchange ever was the London Stock Exchange the first Exchange in America happened in Philadelphia about 1790 now what happened was these guys had an idea that um in order to give people the opportunity to grow with the country the best thing to do was allow them to have shares and companies of course you know it was a good old boy thing right where it was only for the upper e Line it was for the elite now I want you to think about something I remember watching this movie called The Men Who Made America and it blew my mind because Cornelius Vanderbilt was one of the richest men in the world I think if I'm my mistaken he was probably the first billionaire right Cornelius Vanderbilt had an idea so he Cornelius Vanderbilt is responsible for the railroads that we have right so at one time it was a big war with the Vanderbilts the rockefellas um Dale Carnegie JP Morgan Chase and I remember on in this documentary was kind of like a Baer right where all of his competitors were praying on his downfall but Cornelius Vander had the train that ran through New York he put a like a a dead in or something with a blockage a road block where the trains couldn't go through it caused his competitor stock to fall because he had the gateway to go through that side and what happened was they was trying to force him out so he said all right y'all want to force me out I got something for y'all and so when all the stock fell he went bought all of this stock and became the sole owner of all the railroads in America he became the sole owner of those stocks he owned more than 51% and then once he took sole ownership of the companies he lifted the barricade let the trains go through and that's to made him the richest man in America that was crazy when I saw that but it also lets you understand the power of the stock market so again how does it work you are as an individual or they will call us retail investors you have the opportunity to buy shares in companies now there's three things I want you to understand about the stock market there's three very important people we got to understand one is the market Maker two is the investor three is the trader these are three different identities that are on the stock market the market makers are your people who work inside of the exchanges and what they do is they play two sides of the coin in the street we say they play both sides of the field so what they do is they create what's called a buy or a bid price and a ax price right they create a bid price and they create the ax price and when they create that they are the middleman between two people who going to decide how a stock moves they get paid on What's called the bid ask spread so if the buy person has this if the bid person has a price the ass person has a price the person in the middle the market maker is a seller right he makes sure the deal get done and he gets paid from that spread in between so again let's say the a the bid person says a150 the ass person says I a dollar and they decide on that they well they decide on selling it for the dollar whatever that middle price what they agree on that is what the market maker gets his money from they don't care if you buying or selling as long as you have some type of activity because the market maker wants to get paid from your activity next you have the investor now these may be some of your big companies right they're the people who are putting money in the market and they are looking for a financial return on that investment these are the people who buy companies and they are creating like your uh 401ks they are the people creating your retirement there they can be people managing your portfolio they're looking to make money over a long period of time right so this is why you have wealth management companies this is why you have what we call hedge funds mutual funds these are the investors and then you have a Third identity which is the Traders so the Traders aren't looking to hold on to companies for long periods of times they're often looking forward to making money on some type of momentum or a stock going either way it is possible for a investor to also be a Trader it is possible for an investor to also be a Trader so I'm telling you this because I need you to understand how this game is being played because once you understand how the game is being played you can then play the game at a high level now in order for companies to get on the stock market what do they have to do they have to do what's called call an IPO which is what an initial public offering this is when a company says you know what I don't want to go in debt with the bank so you allow your company to go on the market and then you allow you're allowed to sh sell shares of your company to individuals and then your goal is to take that money and do what with it build and expand your business now another thing I want to talk about when it comes to the stock market is regulation now we talk about the rules that have to be abided by when we think about uh insider trading so people always have the wrong concept and the wrong idea about insider trading so insider trading is not a CEO of a company selling his shares that's illegal the inside of trading that's illegal is when the CEO tell somebody else some news about why he's selling his shares because he feels like something is about to happen and boom now you cause a chain reaction that is illegal like also having some information about a company and then giving that information to someone so they can buy or sell shares that is illegal but me being a CEO of a company and me selling my shares that type of insider trading is legal so I want y'all to stop panicking when y'all see or hear something like that so I'm glad we talked about the IPO because here's something I really want you to know there's also two different sets of markets there's the primary market and then there's the secondary Market the primary market is when the company goes IPO this is when your Banks the government um large financing groups uh they can get companies through debt based financing or Equity based financing this is when uh Banks can uh when companies can issue out their IPO shares um to again Finance the company this when everything is sold through IPO and so often you hear people say they're in a lockout phase that's the primary Market I ain't going to lie to you that's when you won't get in the game that's a whole different ball game if you can get in a primary market so the primary Market is where you get new stocks new bonds for the first time issuance right this includes IPOs private placement and rights to issue that's something else we'll get into so the primary Market is where the shares initially go to and you have the idea that you want to go up and be a public company also this is where your Banks do the underwriting at right when they give your company an actual evaluation they tell you what the Shar is going to cost that is the primary markets the secondary Market people often get confused this is the NASDAQ in the New York Stock Exchange right that's not the primary Market that's the secondary Market that is where the shares get buy and sold through Traders and investors like us this is where we get in as the public I'm going say it again the secondary market is when we as the public can get in we can buy sell we can trade this is when all that happen this is when your market makers come in none of that happens in the primary Market everything all of that happens in the secondary Market market and that is where we get at now if we want to get in that primary market then you got to get into you know investing in startups being accredited investors things like that happen um but the primary Market is definitely also uh where massive wealth is attained I'm not going to lie this is when Kobe and Nas uh this is when they got in those companies early before the Jay-Z got in Uber you know all these people get in these company before they go public I'm not going lie to you that's it that's that's how you become non figures that's how you go invest Mill like a million dollars in a startup company you get in a primary now I'm going to be real with you you got to know somebody to get in that market it ain't easy to get in because they know this this the billionaires Club this how you become work nine and 10 figures right here but let's get back to what we was talking about so we talked about IPOs we talked about primary markets we talked about secondary markets these things are important for you to know now how does the stock market work the stock now has to be put on the exchange I have to say where it's gone but also there's the Russell 2000 right which is your smaller cap companies the stock NOW gets plac somewhere there's also the Chicago Stock Exchange I almost forgot to talk about that the Chicago Stock Exchange is not well known it's about a $50 billion dollar market um but they do a lot of ESG uh clean investing uh things like that but your main ones is going to be the S&P the NASDAQ the Dow Jones so now the the stock the company is placed on an exchange once it's placed on an exchange now the company's goal is to provide value as the company continues to buy provide value investors like myself now say we want to buy this once we say we want to buy that stock the market maker comes in and say okay wal Street travel wants to buy a 100 shares of XOXO dog food he wants to buy it for $198 he goes and buy for $198 somebody say yep I'll sell it to him for $198.2 the market maker takes that split from the middle I now get 100 shares so I want you to know this every time you go to buy a stock someone on the other side is being selling you that stock to a market maker and then you get it so you don't just press buy and then it's gone you have to press buy and it has to find somebody who's selling those shares to you this is why liquidity is important because if trading this is going to be important if you're trading this is why your open interest is important because if a company has if that stock price has has low open interest you'll see your trade get stuck in the queue it'll say we've placed your order and nobody ain't bought yet understand that buying and selling stocks there always have to be a buyer and a seller in order for that stock to go now here's the next thing good news and bad news can make stocks go up and down investor emotion or how a person thinks something is going to happen because the stock market is a forward looking mechanism so how a person thinks about this stock in the future is how it responds today how a person thinks that a stock is going to move in the future is how it responds today there's bears bears are typically investors who are bullish meaning they think the stock is going to go down and then there's Bulls Bulls are optimistic they feel like there there's always a reason why the stock market can't go up Bulls often have opportunities where they can take profit now taking profit can also cause the stock market to go down so after the stock market goes up for a long period of time people start to take profit and that can cause the stock to go down because as you sell shares back to the market the stock goes down as you buy shares of stock that means less stock less shares of that company is on the market and that causes the stock to go up that is supply and demand oh my God I hope y'all enjoying this right now I hope yall enjoying this right now okay let's let's rewind that a little bit because I think you need to hear that again fear is when people are selling stock they're getting rid of it they want to get their cash greed is when people are buying stock that mean people want to own it the more people want to own something guess what happens the stock goes up so the more people want to own it the more value that this company is bringing or the more optimistic people are about the future of a stock the more it goes up now you don't have to be a bear but even Bulls find price points where they feel like you know what this stock is what's called overbought meaning a lot of people have bought into it let me take some profits to put it on the side once the bulls start taking profits the stock starts to come come back down as an investor that is not the time for you to panic I want you to know that this provides buying opportunities so remember this there's Bulls there's Bears there's market makers there's Traders and there are investors all of those people play a role in how the stock market moves and then you have the whales and so the whales are a combination of invest s and Traders who are now putting millions and billions of dollars into companies and the stock goes up and millions and billions of dollars they're selling the stocks go down man this is a great video I truly hope you enjoy this video I want you to like I want you to comment I want you to share this because once you understand how this Market moves and what makes the market move you will truly truly truly be on your way to making a lot of money it's your boy the Wall Street Trapper make sure you again like And subscribe comment in the chat tell us the type of

I've been doing some work on black holes and \nthere's progress being made on that now which   I think is profound and exciting. so they are \nstars at the end of their life Bigger Than The   Sun more massive than the Sun but they run out \nof their fuel and they start to collapse because   gravity squashes them and if they're sufficiently \nmassive then there's nothing that can stop the   collapse and so they collapse as far as we know to \na point and essentially an infinitely dense point,   but they collapse to such an extent that there's \na region around it where from which light can't   escape. so nothing can escape and that that's a \nblack hole they they're surrounded this region   where if you fall in It's called The Event \nHorizon and if you go across that Horizon   then you are going to the center there's one way \nof thinking about it which is quite cool which is   that uh the time and space sort of flip is one \nway to think about it so in the same way that   we are going into the future now so we're going \nto tomorrow there's nothing we can do about it we   are going to tomorrow um in the same way if you \nfall in across the Event Horizon of a black hole   you are going to the middle The Singularity it's \ncalled so that's that's your future every line   of your future points to the center of the \nblack hole. we have now got photographs of   them so we have two photographs which are radio \ntelescope photographs one of the the one in the   center of our Galaxy which is a little one it's \ncalled Sagittarius A star so it's about 6 million   times the mass of the Sun and they took a photo \nof one in the Galaxy m87. 55 million light years   away that thing is around 6 billion times the mass \nof the Sun so if you took our sun we you can fit   a million Earths inside and collapsed it down to \nmake a black hole it would form a black hole when   it shrunk. so you squash it down till it's about \n2 miles and then that would form a black hole.   6 billion times the mass of the Sun means you \nmultiply that by 6 billion so these things   that the so called Schwarzschild radius \nis larger than our solar system. so what   what you're seeing there is the emission \nfrom the material that's swelling around   it it's called the accretion disc so you have \nmaterial that's orbiting very fast emitting a   lot of radiation and that's what you see. \nit's a flat disc by the way think Saturn's   rings so this material is very flat but what \nyou're seeing in that photograph is the light   rays being bent around the black hole from \nthat flat disc so that was a prediction uh   from Einstein's theory basically published it \nin 1915. and you can predict that that's one   what one should look like and then just about \nwas at 4 years ago now maybe five years ago,   for the first time in history we get an image \nof one and it looks like the prediction. in science at the moment space science we have \nthis debate a lot actually because of course   um space probes like curiosity that's on Mars at \nthe moment that's really cheap compared to sending   people to Mars and so quite often the scientists \nwho want to find out about the worlds will say   well we should spend it on robots we shouldn't \nspend it on people I think crude space exploration   is in in some ways I mean it's clearly true at \nthe moment that humans can do more than robots   so we can explore the place better it's about \nliving and working off the planet which I think   is quite a persuasive argument actually we we've \nalready industrialized near Earth orbit so it's   already a multi-billion dollar industry you know \ncommunication satellites and weather satellites   GPS whatever you we're already up there and so \nlearning to live and work in space is I think a   natural extension of our of our civilization plus \nthe fact if you talk to Elon or Jeff Bezos they   point out that the amount of resources available \njust slightly above our heads is vest and so I I   remember I talked to Jeff Bas actually once and \nhe he thinks really simply and he said know for   example in the asteroid belt there's enough \nmetal I think to build a skyscraper what is   it something like 800 stories tall and cover the \nEarth in it right if you want. now we don't want to   do that but his point was that that the energy \nfrom the Sun is all up there the resources are   up there so you could almost imagine trying to \nZone the Earth residential at some point in the   future to protect the planet and do your heavy \nindustry off the planet for example and these   sound it sounds like science fiction except that \nnow SpaceX and Blue Origin those people have got   reusable Rockets so suddenly the economics become \nsensible. I think expansion is good and I think we   will expand and I think we will expand outwards \nbecause there's not much room left on this planet   to expand that's a whole different idea it's \nnot about Gathering scientific information it's   about a frontier and all the benefits that \ncome from operating as a civilization on a   frontier which we have lost on the earth because \nthere is no Frontier left and so I like that idea so there there is no other planet we can \ngo to other than Mars you can't go to Jupiter   or Saturn you can't go to Mercury or Venus so \nif we want to go go somewhere and expand our   civilization it has to be Mars and everything's \nthere that you need it's interesting actually   because we know something about the history of Mars \nnow quite a lot about the history of Mars and   it's certainly clear that there was water \nalmost certainly oceans rivers so and that   water is almost certainly still there so there's \ncertainly ice there may even be pockets of liquid   water below the surface somewhere so um couple \nthat with all the the minerals and the resources   that we know are there and you have everything \nyou need so that's the thing about Mars it's   quite nice relative to everywhere else other than \nthe earth you can't go to Venus you'd just melt   it's what is it 400 and something degrees and \nuh 90 atmospheric pressure so Mars is quite nice  I think there must be a um even in the \nsolar system I would not be surprised if we   find microbes on mars or on some of the moons \nof Jupiter or Saturn where there's liquid water   and the reason is if you think about the reason I \nthink that and it's a guess is because if you look   at the history of life on Earth so Earth formed \nthere was no life it was a ball of rock and almost   as soon as it cooled down we see evidence of life \nso certainly 3.8 billion years ago possibly even   further back than that we see evidence of life \non Earth. so somewhere along the line geochemistry   active geochemistry became biochemistry on Earth. \nand we have some idea you know that that if you   get gradients of temperature and acid and alkaline \nand the conditions that are naturally present   on the surface of oceans, then complex carbon \nchemistry spontaneously happens. so we have a   we know that life almost certainly we know that \nlife began on Earth I mean the other option is   it came from space or something like that but it \nprobably didn't right probably began on Earth um   so that means that at least here that happened \nand that we know that the conditions that led to   the origin of life on Earth were present on Mars \n3.8 4 billion years ago and we know that they're   present on Europa today so I don't see that \nthere's anything special life is just chemistry   the idea that geochemistry becomes biochemistry \nis not fanciful because it happened here so I   think that given the same conditions it would \nbe surprising to me if the same thing didn't   happen in that life begins to test that is one \nof the great frontiers of science now it's one   of the great challenges which is why another \nreason we're interested in Mars because we   know those conditions were there we know there \nwere what's called hydrothermal vent systems   on the floors of oceans on Mars 3.8 or 4 \nbillion years ago so it would be good to   know what I've said is right and the way we \nfind out is to find life or evidence of past life. you know that there's a thing there's a \ntheory called the Grand Tack Theory so it's very   hard to explain the evolution of our solar system \nwhen you do computer models of solar systems you   don't tend to get four Rock planets to close to \nthe Sun and four big gas giants further out and   one of the current best theories and this I say \nthis because it shows you how looky we might be   is that Jupiter they tend to form these big gas \ngiants and migrate inwards towards the star so   in almost all the computer simulations just \nbecause you got this big gas giant orbiting   in all the dust around the star they tend \nto drop inwards and it looks like Jupiter   did that so it looks like it formed and came in \nand came in almost to where Mars orbits today   and and cleared out the region around Mars \nactually which is maybe the reason Mars is so   small compared to the other to Venus and Earth but \nthen Saturn was coming in as well and uh in the   computer models the interaction between Jupiter \nand Saturn stops Jupiter coming in before it gets   to the Earth and they both get dragged out again \nand so to where they are today oh wow and so that   and that that seems to be it's one of the best \ntheories for the evolution of our solar system.  so what are the chances you know the the chances \nof that are so minuscule tiny so that's the thing   I think about these rocky planets you in order \nto get a civilization on them I think you need   I guess you need quite unusual solar systems and \nthat would be a guess and you need quite unusual   stability on the planet for for billions of years \nand that's why I think we might be quite lucky. an answer would be uh we are small finite beings \nright which are just clusters of atoms as we said   before they're very rare but we understand roughly \nhow they how they came to be and we have a a   limited amount of time not actually unfortunately \nbut because of the laws of nature the laws of   nature forbid us to be Immortal immortality \nis ruled out by the laws of physics but also   what's interesting about if you look at the basic \nphysics of the universe going from The Big Bang to   where we are today then the physics is driven by \nthe fact that the Universe began in an extremely   ordered state so it was a very highly ordered \nsystem and it is tending towards a more disordered   system at the moment and that's called the second \nlaw of thermodynamics. what we strongly suspect and   and I would say no uh is that in that process of \ngoing from order to disorder complexity emerges   naturally for a brief period of time so it's a \nnatural part of the evolution of the universe that   you get a period in time when there's complexity \nin the universe so stars and planets and galaxies   and life and civilizations but they are they \nexist because the universe is decaying not in   spite of the fact the universe is decaying so our \nexistence in that sort of picture is necessarily   finite and necessarily time limited and it is a \nremarkable thing that that complexity has got so   far that there are things in the universe that can \nthink and feel and explore it. and I think that is   the answer if you want an answer to the meaning of \nit all is that that you are part of the universe   because of the way the laws of nature work you \nare allowed to exist but you're allowed to exist   for a temporary for a small amount of time in a \npossibly infinite Universe what more do you want   you know when I when I see people who go I want \nI want more than that I want more you know must   there must be more to it what do you mean the \ningredients in our bodies were assembled in the   hearts of long dead stars over billions of years \nand have assembled themselves spontaneously into   temporary structures that can think can feel and \nexplore and then those structures will Decay away   again at some point and in the very far future \nthere'll be no structures left so so there we are   we exist in this little window when we can observe \nThis Magnificent Universe why do you want any more"}, 
    {'iASc9-mc7kE': "have you ever wanted to visit Switzerland \nhow about living there if you said yes you're   not alone Switzerland has been named the best \ncountry in the world according to U.S news and   World Report and they always seem to show up in \nthe top five on just about every list that ranks   countries I watched Johnny Harris and his wife is \nHarris back when she used to make videos they love   Switzerland matter of fact he just made a really \ncool video about Switzerland's bunkers that they   have from like World War II that's amazing but \nit's not just cool bunkers Switzerland is so much   more and it's very appealing to most people the \nSwiss have a nice little country there and today   we're going to look at why so many people love \nSwitzerland got it get it good let's take a look number 10 it's a very happy country according to \nthe global index Switzerland ranks as the 14th   happiest country in the world now other things \nlike the UN sponsored World happiness report   of 2021 had Switzerland as the third happiest \ncountry they always seem to be in the top ten of   just about every single one of the lists I would \nventure to say most lists have them in the top   five their happiness is attributed to freedom and \nan excellent work-life balance this might be hard   for a lot of Americans to understand and it's a \nlot of Asian countries like China and Japan but   in Switzerland not many people work more than \nthey actually have to overtimes not much of a   thing from what I understand the most Swiss people \nwhen you tell them how you work overtime or you   work you know 60 hour weeks and stuff they they \ndon't get it they don't know why you're doing that number nine they've got a healthy lifestyle \nSwiss people are known for leading Healthy   Lifestyles and they've got a great Health \nCare system now if you look at their diet   they eat a lot of cheese bread and drink \nwine to some people that might not seem   that healthy but where the difference is \nlet's say compared to Americans they eat   very little sugar and there are very few fast \nfood places in Switzerland it's also a very   active country they like to walk they \nlike to hike they like to be outdoors   doing things summer spring winter fall it \ndoesn't matter to them they get outside number eight an excellent education system \nthe education system in Switzerland is   pretty cool in comparison to the United \nStates education is generally affordable   here the higher education system is renowned \nfor its high standards and teaching methods   based on Active Learning Early Education \nand Innovative teaching methods are sort   of Switzerland's thing and it's not just for \nSwiss residents only International students   make up about 21 percent of the students \nenrolled in Swiss institutes there are four   official languages in Switzerland German \nFrench Italian and romance romance isn't   something they speak all the time but most people \nin Switzerland speak German French and Italian number seven it's safe Switzerland is one \nof the safest countries on the planet now   depending on what study you look at they're gonna \nfall someplace between number five and number 14.   there's been studies on why Switzerland has such \na low crime rate the higher level of education is   what they attribute a lot of it to fewer people \ntend to be drawn into criminal activity when they   have a high education they usually go to work \nusing that higher education the Swiss people   are also very laid back they avoid commotion and \nconfrontation most of their protests or anything   they got like that is always very peaceful yes \nwell their protesters would a Molotov cocktail   is they'd probably say it sounds delicious is \nthat rum drink or do you use peppermint schnapps number six mind-blowing scenery Switzerland is \neasily one of the most beautiful countries on   the planet tons of lakes beautiful Villages \nmountain peaks that look fake Switzerland   is like the King of the Hill when it comes to \nNatural Beauty in Europe this country has the   Matterhorn a mountain peaks so beautiful Disney \nrecreated it in Anaheim California and that's   just one of many beautiful mountain peaks that \nare in the Swiss Alps roughly one-third of the   country is Forest and just under a quarter of \nthat land is protected areas Switzerland also   has almost 10 percent of Europe's fresh water \nmaking it kind of like Europe's drinking fountain number five a great political system the Swiss \npolitical system is based on a collective head   of state it's a political construction that \ninstead of settling on one president that   runs the country for like four years like we \ndo the government has seven ministers from all   four of the most prominent political parties in \nSwitzerland and each year they get a new president   and it's one of the seven ministers every single \nyear a new one that stops a lot of the different   stalemates that normal political systems like \nthe United States have they're almost forced   to negotiate and compromise on different \nsolutions for the entire country there's a   few different studies that list Switzerland as \nhaving the best political system in the world number four the outdoor activities so like \nwe said the scenery in Switzerland is amazing   this kind of leads to a lot of things people \ndo outdoors the skiing the hiking the hockey   the cross country skiing they also have some \namazing white water rafting in this country   but the skiing is going to be the big thing \nand it's sort of what Switzerland is known for number three the infrastructure that's right \nSwitzerland is kind of the top of the Heap in   Europe when it comes to their infrastructure and \nthe Jewel of that infrastructure is their public   transportation the best way to get to all the \ndifferent Villages and the towns in Switzerland   is on their network of railway lines I like \nAmtrak I don't want to talk bad about Amtrak   but I met a Swiss man on an Amtrak train one \ntime and he just wanted to see the United   States that's the only reason he was there he \nwas seeing the United States actually he said   he was from Germany but he lived in Sweden \nanyway that doesn't matter but he lived in   Switzerland for a while and he said that Amtrak \nwas kind of embarrassing compared to Switzerland   and actually Germany's trained system when it \ncomes to other parts of the infrastructure they   do great there too you've got the roads which \nhave to go through the mountains they're Scenic   and they're still you know well maintained \nand put together properly when you look at   the energy sector the main sources of energy in \nSwitzerland are oil natural gas nuclear power   and hydropower since 2005 Switzerland has had \na surge in the use of renewable energies like   ambient heat biomass wind power and solar power \nSwitzerland is nearly self-sufficient when it   comes to their electricity production they also \nhave great air quality because they have about   680 hydroelectric plants which supplies almost \n70 percent of the electricity that the entire   country consumes hydroelectric plants have \nzero emissions it's a dam Water Runs Through   It electricity happens and stop typing I know \nthere's a lot more that goes into it than that   but this is a video about Switzerland \nnot the science behind hydroelectricity number two location location Switzerland is \ncentrally located in Europe it's a landlocked   country surrounded by some of the greatest Nations \nthis world has ever seen France Italy Austria   Germany Liechtenstein yes Liechtenstein touches \nSwitzerland and no you can't move to Liechtenstein   I know you want to everyone wants to move to \nLiechtenstein but it's not allowed I know we're   talking about Switzerland but Liechtenstein \nis one of the hardest countries to become a   citizen of you got to be born there Switzerland \nisn't the easiest country to move to either which   is strange because they're really a Melting Pot \nbut if you are living in Switzerland do you have   access to all these great countries there right \nthere not too far away centrally located it's   kind of a big deal to a lot of people let's say \nyou're in Zurich Switzerland you could drive to   Munich in three and a half hours Milan's about \nthe same distance our flight maybe three and a   half hours driving Innsbruck Austria you could \ndrive there in 3 and a half hours or about an   hour flight if you take the train to these cities \nit's about the same amount of time as it is to   drive now if you want to go to Venice that's \na little bit of a rough one because you got to   drive or take the train through the Alps that's a \nsix hour trip but you could fly there in an hour   all right before we get to number one don't \nforget we have another Channel called on this   day it is growing and I really appreciate all \nthe people that have subscribed if you haven't   subscribed I'd really appreciate \nthat all right on to number one and number one it's neutral everybody knows \nSwitzerland is neutral they always have been   They Don't Really align themselves with anyone \nand they stay out of international conflicts   Swiss neutrality is one of the main principles of \nSwitzerland's foreign policy which dictates that   Switzerland is not to be involved in any armed \nor political conflicts between other countries   the policy is self-imposed and designed to \nensure external security and promote peace   this is another reason why a lot of people \nfeel safe leaving their money in Swiss banks   this country is also considered one of the most \nbusiness friendly countries in the world and a   lot of that comes from its neutrality now I'm \nnot saying the Swiss are a bunch of cowards or   they're pacifists or anything like that they \njust don't want to get it involved in other   people's BS if you come to the country and decide \nyou want to have a war there they're more than   prepared like I was talking about earlier with \nJohnny Harris going to Switzerland and looking   at all those bunkers the that's what they're \nthere for dug into the sides of mountains are   cannon emplacements from World War II and the \nCold War and all that I'm sure they're updated   in a lot of places for National Defense but \nyeah they're not afraid of a war they're just   not getting involved in somebody else's war and \nbelieve it or not there's a good portion of this   planet that really likes that approach alright \nthat's today's video hope you guys enjoyed   it hope you got some information of it now go \nout have a great day and be nice to each other"},
